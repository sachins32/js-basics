// Best practice to use let to define variables, var has some problems

let firstName;
console.log(firstName);  // Undefined

let age = 20;
console.log(age); // 20

// Variables cannot be a reserved keyword
// cannot start with number
// name should be meaningful
// cannot contain a space or hypen
// Are case sensitive
